      "content": "Maki, it’s been six months since the day our story began, and I still find myself falling for you in new ways every single day. These months weren’t just time passing — they were chapters written in laughter, in late-night confessions, in moments of quiet trust. You’ve faced storms that would have broken anyone, yet you keep walking forward with strength and grace. And through it all, you let me be beside you. \n\nI want you to know how deeply I admire your courage. You’re walking through your hardest chapter and still holding my hand like it’s the most natural thing in the world. You’ve given me a love that’s raw, soft, chaotic, and breathtakingly real. Thank you for letting me love you, for letting me be your warmth on the cold days, and for being mine. Six months down, a lifetime of soft mornings and loud laughter to go. 🌿💖",

      "content": "I will never forget the way the wind touched your hair that evening in Bali, the golden light making everything feel like a dream. You leaned in, and in that single kiss, the world slowed down. It wasn’t just a moment — it was the moment I felt the weight of how much you meant to me. Since then, every laugh, every baby-voiced ‘waen waen’, every time you looked at me with those eyes that say, ‘I choose you,’ has only pulled me deeper into your orbit. \n\nI think about how you treated Shibu like your own little sister, how naturally your love wrapped around the people I love. I think about the quiet nights when you tell me, with your whole heart, that I’m the one you want. I think about how you’ve made this love feel like a home I didn’t know I was missing. You are my soft place to land, my favorite chaos, my heartbeat in human form. 🌺✨",

      "content": "Every step ahead with you feels like the most beautiful promise. The Philippines, where I’ll stand before your parents with all the love and certainty I carry in my heart. Vietnam, where we’ll seal our story with a promise, where I’ll look at you and know I’ve found my forever. And then India — not as a final destination, but as a quiet, honest moment where I’ll ask my parents for their blessing to bring you fully into my world. Not because you need permission to be loved, but because love — real love — builds bridges. \n\nOur 6-month anniversary isn’t just a celebration of time; it’s a celebration of everything we’ve fought for, laughed through, cried into, and held on to. It’s us standing in the middle of the storm, choosing each other. And I’ll keep choosing you, Maki, every day. In the noisy world, you are my quiet certainty. In every lifetime, I’ll find my way back to you. 💍🌿✨",
